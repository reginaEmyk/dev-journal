title: Starting a Developer Journal
date: '2024-10-15'
tags: ['Journey begginings', 'indie dev', 'Fixate your learning']
draft: false
summary: The first post in my long-required journal of Things I Learned (the 'About' is more heartfelt & funny go there)
---

The 'Fail Fast Learn Faster', 'Your brain needs to recall an information within varying time-intervals to store it in permanent memory' and 'Just ship it' mentalities inspired me to initiate a journal website.
Mostly to keep what i learned, share it and remember it.

I have just learned it's displaying the previous day of the informed post creation date.

This blog is supposed to be a tool for continuous improvement, logging information for insights and fomenting the discipline of sticking to things
(although giving up on things is effective-- learned that from attending places turned awful, from teacher losing a Google offer after insisting on an impossible problem, and my 1st boss' knowledge)

If you want to understand more about what drives a tech professional -- and this person -- see the 'About' in top right
{/\* Hopefully this also increase communication skills by training writing
Also! It should have useful features in the future, like a notepad with charcount that keeps data on user-side

I've read 'user' is too generalistic of a word, but it _is_ an useful one \*/}

- This blog was made from this awesome repo: timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog. Thanks to the community and builders.

Things I've heard today

- Developer landscape is harsh in the US. Maybe newer areas with a growing window of necessity, ones that seem to require professionals in the future, with most assurance, might be smarter to dedicate to (AI, security...)
