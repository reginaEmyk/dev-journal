Regina Emyk is an indie developer in training at Houve Ltd and a CS student. Hi.

I want to explore fintech, biotech, security, AI & blockchain-- having mostly developed customer-obsessed products using LLM APIs.
Currently worried about shipping this blog in order to centrally register learnings.

{/_ Tough I don't care much about areas or technologies-- a certain Ted Talk constituted a thought within me: people make money, then make charity, because if money is a means to acquire solutions (like goods or services), what solution will you acquire?
I don't know, but satisfaction seems like a criteria for choosing. What brings satisfaction, aquiring what you want or need? Following that example, it's being helpful in a positive or neutral way to other parties. (nevermind charity is also a means for tax evasion)
Thus, solving large scale and influential problems seems satisfactory, as that gives assurance to a person of doing good _/}

Tough I don't care much about areas or technologies-- a certain Ted Talk constituted a thought within me: people make money, then do charity, because people inherently want to be good.

What is that?

Heroes help, and being ideally 'good' seems to be helpful in a positive to some and/or neutral way to other parties.
I believe, solving crucial problems -- i.e. issues in basic service access, of biological nature, and other things that change the every day of affected parties-- is helpful, and affecting many is helpful {/* to many needs large scale and influential problems seems satisfactory, as that gives assurance to a person of doing good */}

TLDR; Thus, I believe shipping large scale solutions to crucial problems is an ultimate satisfaction.

(Now I realize the happiness of winning a Nobel prize includes the assurance of excelling at that)

To achieve that, categorizing a problem's area is a tool, and tools are best chosen second fittingness to a solution-- a reason why being adaptive is crucial!

Specializing in an area allows you to solve certain problems that less people can solve, but despite a few interests, improving many people's lives by solving high-impact issues is my pursual over specific topics.

You who found this: please say Hi as well

Note: Mentioned money and charity to explain the want to be 'good', nevermind tax evasion I still believe people want to be good
